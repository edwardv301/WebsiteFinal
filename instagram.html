                <p>Instagram is a social app that can be used for teaching and learning in Education. There are over 1 Billion
                    users on instagram with 72% being teenagers. 35% of the teenagers in the US said that Instagram is their
                    preferred social media platform. This just shows that instagram has a huge potential to be used in
                    Education.<br>

                <br>One of the first things a teacher should do if wanting to use Instagram as an educational tool is to set up a
                    private classroom account which every student can join and follow. Then following from that, here are a few
                    examples of how Instagram can be used for the purpose of Education in a classroom:<br>

                    <br><b>1. Finding Ideas:</b><br>
                    A great way teachers can find new and interesting ideas to use in class would be to search around
                    on Instagram, there are many teacher and educational accounts around that can be followed and
                    provide great ideas. Following the hashtag #teachersofinstagram will help a teacher find those
                    accounts easily.<br>

                    <br><b>2. Capture Memories</b><br>
                    A teacher can post pictures of a lot of the memories made in class. This can be from regular days in
                    class, to going on a trip or completing cool activities. This can remind the students of these
                    memories and also allow their parents to see all the interesting things their children are doing at
                    school.<br>

                    <br><b>3. Show Students Work</b><br>
                    Instagram is a perfect place to showcase student's works and achievements, since it works on a
                    basis of posting pictures with a caption underneath. The class account can act as a place to post
                    award winning projects and achievements that the students have made.<br>

                    <br><b>4. Help Students</b><br>
                    Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects.
                    They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. The
                    comments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of one
                    another that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask a
                    question relating to a post privately if they don't want to comment.<br>

                    <br><b>5. Subjects</b><br>
                    Instagram can be used in many different ways depending on the subject being taught. For example, students can use Instagram to create a photo gallery of their photos or projects in art class.
                    This gives parents, students and teachers to see their work, like and comment. It can also
                    lead to them gaining followers that like their work and build a future portfolio and following
                    which will be useful in the future.

            <h2>Cautions</h2>
        </div>    

        <div class="row4">    

            <div class="col3">
                <p>When using any social media app in general, there will always be an issue with safety. Using them with
                    caution can minimize the risk but you will never truly be safe when using them as information gets leaked
                    all the time. The best practice is to only put up and share information that you feel comfortable with
                    everyone knowing.<br>
                    Some basic things you should know:<br><br>
                    <b>Don’t share your password with anyone<br><br>
                    Even if you keep your account limited or private, it can still reach a wider audience<br><br>
                    Think about what you’re posting. Can someone find you through the picture?<br><br>
                    Instagram isn’t reality as people only post the best parts of their life</b><br><br>
                    With Instagram in general, there are many ways that you can stay protected. One of the easiest ways is to
                    put your account on private. This will restrict access to your account, meaning no one can view your posts
                    unless they follow you. People can request to follow you but is it your decision whether you want them to be
                    able to view your account. You also have the option to choose who can comment on your posts. Your
                    Instagram Stories are also private.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, if your account is set on private, your profile is still public so they can see your profile photo, bio
                    and username. This shouldn’t be an issue as long as you don’t have any information you’re not comfortable
                    sharing with everyone.<br><br>
                    You should also be careful when sharing beyond Instagram. If you have any other accounts on other sites
                    like Facebook and they aren’t private, it could be shared to everyone.<br><br>
                    People can also get to your account if you like other people’s post and if you’re tagged in their posts or
                    stories. You can un-tag your account from posts but you can’t from stories so you can ask the person to
                    remove you from the story. Stories aren’t permanent so after 24 hours they get removed.<br><br>
                    If someone is harassing you, you can always block them and report them to Instagram. Try your best to
                    ignore them and don’t post anything to aggravate them. You can also report people if they’re impersonating
                    you or if they are a spam account.<br><br>
                    If you take these cautions into consideration,
                    you can minimize the risk that comes with Instagram or any social media.
