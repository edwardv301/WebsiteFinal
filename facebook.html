        <h2>Facebook</h2>
        <p>Facebook is the largest social media network in the world, with<br>  around 2.5 billion
            monthly users. It is a platform that offers you<br>  a space online to share photos, videos
            and updates on your daily<br>  life. People create profiles on facebook, which can be
            personal or<br>  non-personal, which then allows them to form relationships<br>  with others
            online.

                <p>Social Media applications were not specifically designed for educational purposes, however it has
                    the potential to further education inside a classroom. Facebook is most appropriate for discussing
                    and sharing world news and major events. The main reason Facebook is used is to connect with
                    friends, family etc. While Facebook is mainly used to connect with people you already know it can
                    also be a great tool for networking. Facebook creates a sense of community amongst its users
                    and this can lead to a widespread of ideas and collaborations.<br><br>

                    Similar to creating an online community Facebook can be used to strengthen communication.
                    Students and teachers and students and their peers are now able to share and join their work
                    together easier than ever. Students can now communicate with their classmates and teachers
                    about their course content, besides from this they can also arrange times to work on group
                    projects.<br><br>

                    Another way Facebook can be used for teaching and educational benefits is the development of
                    computer skills. Students are developing writing and communication skills through self-expressing
                    posts as well as several other skills such as editing and proofreading.

            <h2>Cautions</h2>
        </div>    

        <div class="row4">    

            <div class="col3">
                <p>Facebook is a social media platform that allows people to share their opinions on specific topics. At
                    times however the ability to share your own opinion of something is misused either by people with
                    conflicting opinions wanting to start an argument and becoming vicious towards one another or
                    by people purposely trolling people so that they can get a reaction from them so everyone can see
                    it.<br><br>
                    As Facebook is a free social media platform, it is necessary for them to make money in other ways.
                    One of the more popular ways is by selling your personal information to advertisement companies,
                    so that specific advertisements will appear in your newsfeed.<br><br>
                    On Facebook nothing you write is private. If you were to comment on a post made by someone,
                    other people can see what you wrote and reply to that specific response.
                    Another reason to be cautious while on Facebook is because of the increase in cyberbullying
                    online. This form of bullying is especially bad as people don’t feel any remorse for the things they
                    say or do as they are protected by a screen and it allows them to say things that they would never
                    say in person.<br><br>
                    Fake accounts are also extremely dangerous. As there is no real verification method to go through
                    when creating a Facebook account, there have been cases where people have made false accounts
                    for malicious purposes. Such as a peadophile luring kids out in public or an account made to mock
                    someone.<br><br>
                    You must make sure that you don’t give out any personal information that you don’t want to be
                    known to other users such as, Facebook asks if you’d like to use your phone number to log you into

                    your account, however this allows other people who view your page to see your phone number.<br><br> You
                    may also want to reinforce your password security by making sure that it wasn’t used before and
                    that it is something unique to you, otherwise people may access your account and see personal
                    information or private conversations.
