        <h2>Reddit</h2>
        <p>Reddit is a social news platform that allows users to discuss and<br>
            vote on content that other users have written about. To help the<br>
            site and prevent spammers from bombarding readers. Reddit<br>
            came up with "karma" points. Users get karma by their comments<br>
            and links being voted by others in the community.<br>

                <p>Reddit is a site that has access to a variety of public where millions of people can share posts. Even
                    through the maze of content, the site is still very easy to navigate, all anyone needs to do is use the
                    search bar at the top to find what they want.<br><br>

                    These are some searches that are relevant to our courses this semester. As well as these two
                    subreddits, there are hundreds of others that are beneficial for many causes. Through the
                    subreddits people can gather up information on almost any topic within seconds. Due to the groups
                    being public there are opinions and different works from people that come from all walks of life,
                    giving others a wide variety of sources to collect information from.<br><br>

                    Reddit is not used in education as much as other social media but still has the potential to be used
                    just as much if not more. Through the wide collection of online resources anyone can find the
                    information they need. For a secondary school student the likes of answers for financial maths or
                    how to properly structure an essay on Shakespere is just a click away. The same for a CDM
                    student, different photography techniques or ways to develop a characters story arc is also right
                    there. Another benefit is that the community is there to help, if you can’t find the answer you’re
                    looking for on the posts of the subreddit you can just ask through your own post and someone is
                    bound to give you an answer sooner or later.<br><br>
                    <b>General Purposes:</b><br><br>
                    For the most part the site is used as news sources and also internet culture. As of today these are
                    the top subreddits that are continuously growing.

                    Through these subreddits people can receive the latest news on the topic that the particular
                    subreddit is talking about. For example, the r/coronavirus has a constant influx of information
                    regarding newly infected people in affected countries and ways to help stop the spread of the virus,
                    the r/PresidentialRaceMemes is keeping up to date with the American presidential campaigns while
                    also adding humour to the matter.

                <p><b>Age Limit:</b> Kids and teens can and do use it, even though it&#39;s generally adult-based.
                    Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account. Reddit users were
                    aged 18 to 29 years.<br><br>
                    <b>Privacy and Security:</b> Reddit collects, uses, and shares information about you when you
                    use the websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services or
                    when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us. Reddit helps
                    protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access,
                    disclosure, alteration, and destruction.<br><br>
                    <b>Trolling:</b> There's two types of trolls- Nasty trolls who just wanna try and drag people
                    down. Interesting trolls who get up to weird shenanigans to gain reactions.
                    Boredom and to see how people do when they take out their element and are forced
                    to actually try and argue the point, not just regurgitate something they were told.
