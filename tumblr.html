        <h2>Tumblr</h2>
        <p>A social media tool and a microblogging platform that allows its users<br> to publish microblogs or short blog
            posts. This application or software<br> can also be explained simply by describing it like Facebook, Twitter<br> and
            a blog e.g. WordPress and Blogger. It was also known as<br> "Tumblelogging" that went before Tumblr itself.

                <p>Tumblr is a content sharing application which makes it a useful resource tool for
                    people to engage with professional work and to learn more about how others view
                    and work.<br><br>
                    Tumblr also invites people to learn about not only new and exciting art forms or styles
                    but also about people's opinions of those styles and forms, as under posts there is the
                    opportunity for commenting your thoughts. Through this, we can learn about so much
                    more of people's experiences and other pieces of knowledge that the commenter has
                    put under.

                <p>How safe is Tumblr?<br><br>
                    The digital Age Of consent in Ireland is set at 16 years of age. You must need the consent of a
                    parent or a guardian if you are under 16.<br><br>
                    Tumblr also has a setting to keep your account more secure by activating 'secure Sockets Layer'
                    that creates a link between a browser and a web server.<br><br>
                    All the blogs are set on public by default. However, you can change the set up on you second blog
                    to keep it private.<br><br>
                    You can also block other users from interacting with you If they or their blogs make you
                    uncomfortable, but you canâ€™t prevent them from checking your blog.<br><br>
                    Tumblr offers Two-Factor Authentication as well. If this is turned on via your account, it will send you
                    a code to your phone that you must use in order to log in.<br><br>
                    Blogs on tumblr are not screened or examined by their Headquarters meaning, anyone can
                    encounter unpleasant content and other explicit material.<br>
                    All the blogs are set on public by default. However, you can change the set up on you second blog
                    to keep it private.<br>
                    Tumblr lacks limitations or rules in the content that are created. Because of this, parents must also
                    be more careful if they give their young children permission to use the app as they could come
                    across hardcore pornography on this site as this application is a totally open platform.
